# Natural Language Processing

### I applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment from news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also applied fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.

## 1. Sentiment Analysis

I Used the newsapi to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum in order to create a DataFrame of sentiment 

## 2. Natural Language Processing

I used NLTK and Python to tokenize the text for each coin. To visualize better, I created a wordcloud of the most occuring words. 

## 3. Named Entity Recognition

I built a named entity recognition model for both coins and visualize the tags using SpaCy.
